## VPC

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a critical building block of cloud infrastructure that enables you to create, customize, and secure your network environment in the cloud. It provides the foundation for deploying and managing cloud resources while offering flexibility, control, and enhanced security.

### Subnet

A subnet, short for "subnetwork," is a division of an IP network into smaller, more manageable segments. Subnetting is a fundamental concept in networking, and it's used to efficiently allocate and organize IP addresses and to control network traffic within a larger network.

### Route Table

A route table is a fundamental networking component used in computer networking and cloud infrastructure to determine how network traffic is directed or routed within a network or between networks. Route tables contain a set of rules, known as routes, that specify where network traffic should be sent based on its destination IP address.
